# RasPi-i2c-model-control

A repository for all things Raspberry Pi and related to driving i2C devices.

The first project this contains is an driver for the MCP23017 16-I/O Expander

In this application the MCP23017 driver is used to control the points and power segment on an "OO" guage model railway, however the principles of control and GUI software can be used elsewhere, for example to control the direction of eight motors and to momentarily activate relays or solenoids.  The uses are endless and this code could be used as a basis to expand from.

Tested on Raspbery Pi Module B but should work on any Raspberry Pi

Enjoy!
