# RasPi-i2c-model-control

A repository for all things Raspberry Pi and related to driving i2C devices.

The first project this contains is an driver for the MCP23017 16-I/O Expander

This MCP23017 direver is used to control the points and power segment on an "OO" guage model railway, however the principles of control and GUI software can be used elsewhere.

Tested on Raspbery Pi Module B but should work on any Raspberry Pi

Enjoy!
